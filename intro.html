                <p>Hello! I am <b>Samiti</b>.I am from Kolhapur.I am 1<sup>st</sup> year AIDS student.At Zeal College of 
                Engoneering and Resarch,Induri.</p>
                <p> I first got into coding back in high school when I took an introductory 
                     <b>C</b> class, and I was instantly hooked by the logic of problem-solving.<br>
                     It's fascinating to see how a few lines of code can solve complex challenges.</p>
                <p>So far, I've primarily worked with <i>C</i> and a bit of <i>HTML/CSS</i> on a 
                    personal project where I built a basic portfolio website.</p> 
                <p>I'm incredibly enthusiastic about technology and am eager to dive deeper into software development.<br>
                     Right now, I'm focused on grasping foundational data structures in my current courses and <br>
                    eventually want to explore front-end development through club projects or potential internships."</p> <br>
